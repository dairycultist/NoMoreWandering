A total conversion mod inspired by BTW.

Instead of making a mod that I enjoy based on its vibes, I'm gonna make a mod that I enjoy based on its gameplay. I find mining fun, so let's commit to a mod that expands on that.

playtest :3

more mobs

more uses for resources, encouraging setting up a base camp (with smelting infrastructure) from which you go underground

need some reason to make interesting infrastructure

change the gameplay so that everything is done with a single end goal in mind (not aimless/player driven). but what goal, and how to get to it?!

I like the seclusion of minecraft

as you progress, hard things get easier but harder things open up

getting iron tools should be a _big achievement_

need more uses for copper

tank u uncleacid for the cherry tree + copper block textures :3

## World

Literally only one biome (plains but with oak/cherry trees added), no more variation, no more exploring :3

**Surface**
- has wood

**Subsurface**
- thin crust below surface
- has coal and copper (copper tools/weapons/armor replace stone/chainmail ones)

**Caverns**
- huge underground cave
- has iron, diamonds, redstone, lapis, and gold

Planned: Underworld
- nether stuff generates in the overworld (nether dimension is removed)
- netherrack require iron to mine (at a reasonable speed)
- diamonds ONLY generate in the underworld

## NOT going to add

- New structures/biomes (exploration is tedious, fun should come from taking advantage of the world's resources, not finding stuff in the world)

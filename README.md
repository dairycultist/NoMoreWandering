# Copper and Caverns

Adds copper and caverns (and cherry trees) to the game with the intent of balancing progression.
Copper tools, weapons, and armor replace stone/chainmail ones. The addition of copper not only
makes you hold onto wooden tools longer, but makes getting iron tools more of a _big achievement_.

Thanks to uncleacid for the cherry tree + copper block textures!

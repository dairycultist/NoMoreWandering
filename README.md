A total conversion mod inspired by BTW.
```
actually change the gameplay
since rn the "mine for funsies and make a house for funsies and run around for funsies" is kinda. aimless
I'd like everything to be done with a single end goal in mind
but idk what or how
I like the seclusion of minecraft
as you progress, hard things get easier but harder things open up

most novelty comes from cool mechanics and mobs :3 (aka not deco blocks, biomes, structures, etc where you have to explore)

- remove wood/stone tool crafting recipe
- make it so you can't mine logs with your hands and flint is a tool now
- also harder mobs
- also crucible that you put ore into, within which it liquifies, and then if you put a cast in it a tool part pops out

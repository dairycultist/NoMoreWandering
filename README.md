A total conversion mod inspired by BTW.
```
actually change the gameplay
since rn the "mine for funsies and make a house for funsies and run around for funsies" is kinda. aimless
I'd like everything to be done with a single end goal in mind
but idk what or how
I like the seclusion of minecraft
as you progress, hard things get easier but harder things open up
```

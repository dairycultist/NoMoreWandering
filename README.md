A total conversion mod inspired by BTW.

Instead of making a mod that I enjoy based on its vibes, I'm gonna make a mod that I enjoy based on its gameplay. I find mining fun, so let's commit to a mod that expands on that.

playtest :3

more mobs

more uses for resources, encouraging setting up a base camp (with smelting infrastructure) from which you go underground

need some reason to make interesting infrastructure

change the gameplay so that everything is done with a single end goal in mind (not aimless/player driven). but what goal, and how to get to it?!

I like the seclusion of minecraft

as you progress, hard things get easier but harder things open up

add copper (replaces stone tools)
 
getting iron tools should be a _big achievement_

## World

Literally only one biome, no more variation, no more exploring :3

surface
- has wood

subsurface
- thin crust below surface
- has copper

caverns
- huge underground cave
- has iron/diamonds

## NOT going to add

- New structures/biomes (exploration is tedious, fun should come from taking advantage of the world's resources, not finding stuff in the world)

surface - thin crust with some basic ore - superhell (huge underground cavern). no more caving

change the gameplay so that everything is done with a single end goal in mind (not aimless/player driven). but what goal, and how to get to it?!

I like the seclusion of minecraft

as you progress, hard things get easier but harder things open up

most novelty comes from cool mechanics and mobs :3 (aka not deco blocks, biomes, structures, etc where you have to explore)

- remove wood/stone tool crafting recipe
- make it so you can't mine logs with your hands
- hitting flint against a rock has a chance of turning it into a new tool (with durability), sharp flint
- can break a log with sharp flint to get tinder (the log doesn't break, just becomes barkless)
- you can place tinder on the ground and repeatedly click it with sharp flint to start a fire
- also harder mobs
- also crucible that you put ore into, within which it liquifies, and then if you put a cast in it a tool part pops out
- temperature mechanic (just too cold is bad, too hot doesn't exist). being in water, being too deep underground, nighttime, etc makes you start freezing, necessitating fires, warm clothing, etc

getting iron tools should be a big achievement, being the culmination of getting smelting infrastructure, heat for caving/surviving night, and mastery of primitive tools

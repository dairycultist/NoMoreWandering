A total conversion mod inspired by BTW.

Instead of making a mod that I enjoy based on its vibes, I'm gonna make a mod that I enjoy based on its gameplay. I find mining fun, so let's commit to a mod that expands on that.

override the biome provider for overworld to be a single biome provider (no more biome variation!!!!)

more mobs

more underground structures with resource loot, and more uses for resource loot, encouraging setting up a base camp from which you go underground

## World

surface
- has wood

subsurface
- thin crust below surface
- has copper

caverns
- huge underground cave
- has iron/diamonds

change the gameplay so that everything is done with a single end goal in mind (not aimless/player driven). but what goal, and how to get to it?!

I like the seclusion of minecraft

as you progress, hard things get easier but harder things open up

- remove wood/stone tool crafting recipe
- add copper (replaces stone level)
- make it so you can't mine logs with your hands
- temperature mechanic (just too cold is bad, too hot doesn't exist). being in water, being too deep underground, nighttime, etc makes you start freezing, necessitating fires, warm clothing, etc

getting iron tools should be a big achievement, being the culmination of getting smelting infrastructure, heat for caving/surviving night, and mastery of primitive tools

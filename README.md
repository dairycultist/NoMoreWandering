# Copper and Caverns

Thanks to uncleacid for the cherry tree + copper block textures!

Internally `nomorewandering` because this was a different project before (I'll fix it later).

## Resource Distribution

**Surface**
- has wood

**Subsurface**
- thin crust below surface
- has coal and copper (copper tools/weapons/armor replace stone/chainmail ones)

**Caverns**
- huge underground cave
- has iron, diamonds, redstone, lapis, and gold

The addition of copper not only makes you hold onto wooden tools longer, but makes getting iron tools more of a _big achievement_.
